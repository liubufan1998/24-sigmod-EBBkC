# Efficient $k$-clique Listing: An Edge-Oriented Branching Strategy

This repository contains the codes and a technical report for $k$-clique listing with the edge-oriented branching strategy. 

## Setup

To run the codes correctly, please ensure you have installed `cmake (minimum version 3.16)` on your computer or server since we need to use cmake to generate `Makefile` to compile our codes.
